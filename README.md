This project involves designing a vibrant animated Haunted Theme Park using rides like Ferris wheel and Carousel. The day-night transition features humans enjoying rides during the day, while ghosts emerge at night, possessing the power to activate rides. A river with boats during the day transforms into a haunted scene at night, with ghosts destroying boats. A lighthouse guides ships, and a lakeside building is visible from the park. Implemented in C++ using GLUT for graphics rendering, OpenGL, and Code Blocks, this project creates a dynamic, eerie environment with interactive elements for both daytime visitors and nighttime spookiness.
